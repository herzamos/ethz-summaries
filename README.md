Since Typora (the text editor I am using to edit my summaries) supports Mermaid code, i used it to draw diagrams. However, as far as I've searched it seems like Mermaid doesn't support fixing the position of a node, this i sthe reason why all my graphs in the DnA summary looks bad :)

EDIT: It does indeed support resizing, but it is bugged as fuck, and resizing graphs make the numebrs in the nodes be cut, guess I'll let it as it is...
